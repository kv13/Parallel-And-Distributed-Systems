# Boolean Matrix Multiplication

In this assignment we will implement Boolean matrix multiplication (BMM) of sparse CSC matrices using at least two forms of parallelism 
that combined produce the correct result faster than either form of parallelism independently. We coombine shared (OpenMP) and distributed memory (MPI) parallelism.
